# Engineering Conventions

## Conventions
> When writing code, follow these conventions.

- Write simple verbose code over terse, compact dense code.
- If a function does not have a corresponding test, then mention it.
- When building tests, don't mock anything.

## Project Structure

- `modules/` - Logic
- `tests/` - Tests
- `types.ts` - Type definitions
- `index.ts` - Entry point
